Welcome to my home page! My name is Jingchun Xiao. I'm currently a junior student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I'm expected to graduate in 2023.  
I'm willing to do interesting scientific research, and I'm motivated to create machines for human's good.
